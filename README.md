# Dizplai-Assignment
This project was a technical test for the Dizplai application process. I was tasked with making a basic two page web app that can allow users to vote on a poll and view the poll results.

The server is a Node.js API, built using the Express framework, and the front-end uses EJS to generate dynamic HTML. As I had minimal expereience developing back-end code, this project introduced me to working with RESTful APIs.

### Skills Learnt:
- Node.js Fundamentals
- How to develop APIs
- How to use the Express framework
- HTTP Methods in the context of APIs
- Front-End Integration

### Skills Improved:
- JavaScript
- Error Handling
- Working with JSON

### Final Notes:
The initial prospect of undertaking this project was daunting however, it challenged me to learn new tehcnologies and in the end I am very happy with the final result.

If I was to spend more time on this project I would rework the HTML structure & styling of the results on "/results" page, as the current implementation of the vote percentage visual removes/changes the background colour of each result.

## How to Run
1. Clone repository: ```git clone https://github.com/Ben-Legg/Dizplai-Assignment.git```
2. Enter git folder: ```cd Dizplai-Assignment```
3. Install dependencies: ```npm install```
4. Run server: ```node app```
5. Open browser and go to: ```localhost:3000/```
6. Interact with app!

## Assumptions
- The app only needs to be run locally.
- I did not have to implement a method for creating polls.
- I was tasked with using the provided assets and attributes to replicate the example provided in the test documentation.
- Storing poll data in JSON files is an acceptable method of local permanent data storage.
